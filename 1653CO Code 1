The dominant faction within the new parliament, The Levellers, have issued a decree that  a head of state shall be elected by the landed men of the British Isles to lead the government with popular support. A small but influential opposition movement known as ‘The Diggers’ have in turn announced their intention to contest the election upon a manifesto that extolls the virtues of communal living within nature. However, agents who seek to extinguish the flame of radicalism and sabotage the electoral process. Royalists, Cromwellian loyalists and the ever present papist threat all continue to operate from the shadows and must be kept at bay.</p>","image_url":"https://i.imgur.com/uh6gyGj.png","winning_electoral_vote_number":270,"advisor_url":"https://i.imgur.com/WhnXbbf.png","recommended_reading":"<ul>\n<li><a href=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-chicago-tribune-biden-endorsement-20200925-lnyxsb5qvrftnjjmj3rnzj33jy-story.html>Our Case For Joe Biden</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/case-trump-166808>The Case For Trump</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/935730100/how-biden-won-ramping-up-the-base-and-expanding-margins-in-the-suburbs>How Biden Won: Ramping Up The Base And Expanding Margins In The Suburbs</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden-us-election-almost-win-votes-concede>Why Did Trump Almost Win?</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.hoover.org/research/no-evidence-voter-fraud-guide-statistical-claims-about-2020-election>No Evidence For Voter Fraud: A Guide To Statistical Claims About The 2020 Election</a></li>\n</ul>","has_visits":0,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":13,"year":1844,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"1653CO"}];e.credits = "IntoTheSituation and Beige";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":39,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":6970,"fields":{"first_name":"Gerrard","last_name":"Winstanley","election":13,"party":"Diggers","state":"Northumbria","priority":1,"description":"<p>1066 was the year that the Saxons who inhabited the hallowed land of England where enslaved by the Yoke of the Norman conquerers.
